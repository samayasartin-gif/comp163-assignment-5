In Challenge 1, I used a while loop to repeatedly apply the steps for the sequence until the number reaches 1, allowing for the user to use any starting number. In Challenge 2, I used for loops to check for prime numbers by testing divisibility from 2 up to one less than the input so the user's input would not be included, this identified whether the number is prime or not. Challenge 3 uses nested loops to print a formatted multiplication table, where the outer loop handles rows and the inner loop calculates and aligns the products across columns. I used Microsoft Copilot with to help correct my multiplication chart since I did not have the correct alignment at first.
